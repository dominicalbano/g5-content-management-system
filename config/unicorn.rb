# Unicorn forks multiple OS processes within each dyno to allow a Rails app to
# support multiple concurrent requests without requiring them to be
# thread-safe. In Unicorn terminology these are referred to as worker
# processes not to be confused with Heroku worker processes which run in their
# own dynos.

# Herokuâ€™s router enforces a 30 second window before there is a request
# timeout. After a request is delivered to a dyno via the router it has 30
# seconds to return a response or the router will return a customizable error
# page. This is done to prevent hanging requests from tying up resources. While
# the router will return a response to the client, the unicorn worker will
# continue to process the request even though a client has received a response.
# This means that the worker is being tied up, perhaps indefinitely due to a
# hung request.

# Preloading your application reduces the startup time of individual Unicorn

# individual worker using the before_fork and after_fork calls.
