## Setup

1. Install all the required gems.

    ```bash
    $ bundle
    ```

1. Set environment variables.

    - For local development defaults in `.env` can be overriden by setting
      the variable in `.env.development`. For example:

          ```bash
          $ echo HEROKU_APP_NAME=my-heroku-app > .env.development
          ```

    - For deployment all variables in `.env` should be set in the deployed
      environment. For example:

          ```bash
          $ heroku config:set HEROKU_APP_NAME=my-heroku-app
          ```

1. Set up your database.

    ```bash
    $ cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml
    $ rake db:setup
    ```

1. Run the specs.

    ```bash
    $ rspec
    ```

1. [Register your oAuth application](https://github.com/G5/g5_authenticatable#registering-your-oauth-application)

1. [Set oAuth Enviroment Variables](https://github.com/G5/g5_authenticatable#environment-variables)

1. Ensure you have [redis](http://redis.io/) in stalled and started.

1. Start the application.

    ```bash
    $ foreman start -f Procfile.dev
    ```


### Client Location Deployment

1. [Get your AWS S3 credentials ready â€” for the client's assets](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3)

1. Set ENV variables. See `.env`.

  * if you have issues connecting to S3 (SocketError: getaddrinfo: nodename nor
    servname provided, or not known) make sure [your region is
    correct](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)


## CSS Naming Conventions

Most CSS will go inside the modules folder. A module is simply a reusable chunk
of CSS. To create a new module do the following:

1. Create a new file inside the modules folder. It should start with an
   underscore and contain the module name. Example: `_panel.css.scss`
1. The module name is the base class, which contains the basic styles for the
   module. Example: `.panel`
1. If there are multiple words in the base class, use dashes. Example:
   `.my-panel`
1. Any component, or part, of the module is a sub-module. The class should be
   the module name, a dash, and the sub-module. Example: `.panel-title`,
   `.panel-footer`
1. For any alternate styles of the module the class should be module name, two
   dashes, and the alternate style name. Example: `.panel--b`, `.panel--large`


## Client Location Sites

- `app/views/layouts/web_template.html.erb` is the layout file
- `app/views/web_templates/show.html.erb` is used to render each page
- `app/assets/stylesheets/web_template.scss` is for __preview mode only__
- `app/assets/javascripts/web_template.js.coffee` is for __preview mode only__
- `app/views/web_templates/stylesheets.scss` is for preview & deployed mode
- `public/javascripts/` if for preview & deployed mode
